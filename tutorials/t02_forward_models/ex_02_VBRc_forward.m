% calculate Q and Vs over time for all anelastic methods using the
% output from the halfspace cooling model.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


% extract variables

% account for the crust
% https://vbr-calc.github.io/vbr/vbrmethods/el/anharmonic/#gu_0_crust
% map Vars.comp to the SV.chi variable 

% put a small amount of melt everywhere above the solidus

% call the VBRc

% contour plot Q, Vs vs depth and time
